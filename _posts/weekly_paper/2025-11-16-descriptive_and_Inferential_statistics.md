# Understanding Descriptive & Inferential Statistics Easily 📊

Statistics is a tool for **finding meaning in data**.  
Raw data alone doesn’t tell us much, it’s just numbers.  
Statistics helps us **organize**, **summarize**, and **interpret** those numbers so we can understand what is happening and make better decisions.

This post explains the two major branches of statistics, **Descriptive Statistics** and **Inferential Statistics**.

## 1. What Is the Purpose of Statistics?

Statistics exists to help us answer three big questions:

1) **What does the data look like?** → *Descriptive Statistics*  
2) **How do different variables relate?** → *Descriptive + Exploratory*  
3) **What can we predict beyond the data we collected?** → *Inferential Statistics*

> **Statistics = A process of finding the “meaning” inside data.**

## 2. Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the characteristics of the data you already collected.

### Why We Need Descriptive Statistics
Raw data is messy.  
Imagine a spreadsheet with 50,000 customer purchase records.
You cannot understand anything by staring at numbers.

Descriptive statistics help by:
- **Summarizing** the data  
- **Organizing** and **visualizing** patterns  
- Showing **typical values**, **variation**, and **distribution shape**  

### What Descriptive Statistics Tell You
1. **Central tendency** : Mean, Median, Mode
2. **Variability** : Range, Variance, Standard deviation
3. **Distribution shape** : Histogram, Skewness, Kurtosis

### Example
If you surveyed 500 students’ heights:

- Average height: 171 cm  
- Most common height: 170 cm  
- Height distribution: slightly right-skewed  

These summaries give you a clear sense of the data without reading all 500 numbers.

## 3. Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics use sample data to make predictions or conclusions about a larger population.

### Why We Need Inferential Statistics
You almost never have access to the **entire population**.

For example, if you want to know the average height of students in Korea, you cannot measure every student.

So you collect a **sample**, and from that sample you **infer** the characteristics of the population.

That process is **inferential statistics**.

### Tools Used in Inferential Statistics 

Inferential statistics often uses several tools to test ideas and make predictions about a population.

- **Hypothesis Testing**  
  A formal process for deciding whether an observed effect is real or due to random chance. (Uses H₀, H₁, p-values, and significance levels.)

- **t-test**  
  Used when comparing the **means of two groups**.  
  Example: “Is Group A’s average score different from Group B’s?”

- **ANOVA**  
  Similar to a t-test but for **three or more groups**.  
  Example: Comparing test scores across multiple teaching methods

- **Regression**  
  Used to understand **relationships** between variables or to **predict** an outcome.  
  Example: Predicting sales from advertising budget

### Example
You measure the height of 500 male students (sample)  
→ Infer the average height of all male students in Korea (population).

Inferential statistics lets you make **general statements** even though you only measured a **small part** of the whole.

## 4. Descriptive vs Inferential

| Category | Descriptive Statistics | Inferential Statistics |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Purpose | Summarize existing data | Predict or conclude beyond the data |
| Deals with | Sample only | Sample → Population |
| Answers | “What does my data show?” | “What does this mean for the population?” |
| Examples | Mean, median, charts | t-test, regression, confidence intervals |
| Risk | No error risk | Has uncertainty & potential errors |

Together, both are necessary in data analysis.

## Summary

- **Statistics exists** to help us understand and interpret data.  
- **Descriptive statistics** summarize what we can see in the data.  
- **Inferential statistics** help us generalize and predict beyond what we observe.
