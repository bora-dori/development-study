# AARRR, Retention, Cohort vs Segment, and RFM

When analyzing user behavior and business growth, it’s helpful to use structured frameworks.  
This post connects three commonly used concepts, **AARRR**, **cohort vs. segment**, and **RFM analysis**, into one consistent view of how we understand customers across the funnel and over time.

## 1. AARRR Framework and Retention and how it relates to Funnel Analysis

**AARRR** is a growth framework that breaks the customer journey into five stages.

- **Acquisition:** How users first discover and enter the product (e.g., ads, SEO, referrals)
- **Activation:** Whether users reach the “first meaningful experience” (e.g., sign-up → first purchase, first successful action)
- **Retention:** Whether users come back and continue using the product over time
- **Revenue:** Whether users generate monetary value (e.g., purchases, subscriptions, upgrades)
- **Referral:** Whether users invite others or spread the product organically

### Retention: Why it’s the most critical stage
**Retention** measures whether users keep returning after their first experience.  
In practice, a product can look like it is growing (high acquisition), but still fail if users leave quickly.

Retention matters because:
- It directly affects long-term revenue
- It stabilizes growth (reduces dependence on paid acquisition)
- It’s often the strongest sign of product-market fit

### Funnel analysis and AARRR
A **funnel** describes a step-by-step drop-off process (e.g., visit → sign-up → onboarding → purchase).  
Funnel analysis helps answer: **“Where are users dropping off?”**

AARRR and funnel analysis are closely related:
- **Acquisition → Activation** is often modeled as a funnel (entry → first success)
- **Revenue** can also be a funnel (view product → add to cart → checkout)
- **Retention** is not a single funnel step—it’s time-based behavior (returning across days/weeks)

## 2. Cohort vs. Segment: What’s the difference?

Both **cohort** and **segment** are ways to group users, but the logic behind grouping is different.

### Segment: grouped by characteristics (who they are)
A **segment** groups users based on shared attributes such as:
- device type (iOS vs Android)
- country (US vs Korea)
- customer type (free vs paid)
- acquisition channel (organic vs ads)

Segments are useful for answering:
- “Which type of users converts better?”
- “Which channel brings higher quality users?”

### Cohort: grouped by a shared event and time (when they started)
A **cohort** groups users who share a specific starting event during the same time period, such as:
- users who signed up in the same week
- users who made their first purchase in the same month

Cohorts are essential for retention analysis because they let you compare behavior over time fairly:
- “Do users who joined in January retain better than users who joined in February?”
- “Did a new onboarding change retention for new users?”

## 3. RFM Analysis: Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value

**RFM analysis** is a customer segmentation method based on purchasing behavior.  
It focuses on three measurable signals:

- **Recency (R):** How recently the customer purchased
- **Frequency (F):** How often the customer purchased
- **Monetary Value (M):** How much money the customer spent

The core idea is simple:
Customers who purchased recently, purchase often, and spend more are usually more valuable and more likely to buy again.

### Why each component matters

#### Recency (R)
Recency is often the strongest predictor of short-term return.
If someone purchased yesterday, they are usually more “active” than someone who purchased a year ago.

Use cases:
- win-back campaigns for customers with low recency
- identifying currently active customers

#### Frequency (F)
Frequency reflects habit and engagement.
High-frequency customers often indicate strong product fit or loyalty.

Use cases:
- loyalty programs
- identifying repeat buyers vs one-time buyers

#### Monetary Value (M)
Monetary captures customer value and spending power.
It helps separate “frequent small buyers” from “high-value premium buyers.”

Use cases:
- targeting high-value customers with premium offers
- prioritizing customer service tiers

## 4. How RFM Segments Customers

RFM is typically implemented by scoring customers (e.g., 1–5) on each R, F, and M dimension, then grouping them into meaningful segments.

Common RFM-based segments include:

- **Champions:** high R, high F, high M  
  Most valuable customers; reward and retain them.

- **Loyal Customers:** high F, decent M  
  They purchase often; focus on engagement and loyalty benefits.

- **Big Spenders:** high M but not always frequent  
  Offer premium bundles or high-end recommendations.

- **New Customers:** high R but low F  
  They just started; focus on activation and habit formation.

- **At-Risk Customers:** low R but high past F/M  
  Previously valuable, now inactive; run win-back campaigns.

- **Lost Customers:** low R, low F, low M  
  Lowest priority unless reactivation cost is low.
